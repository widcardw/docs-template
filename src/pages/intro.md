## Introduction

This is an optionated notes deployment template. It's based on the [Astro Docs Theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/docs/).

## What For?

This template is designed for those who want to share their Obsidian projects or markdown notes with others by deploying them as SSG.

## Features

### With Obsidian

I like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my "second brain", and I treat my notes or documents as a project.

Markdown is quite a flexible mark up language. We can add some extensions to make it easy-to-use.

### Deployment

I'd like to share them with friends, so I use [Astro](https://astro.build) to make a SSG deployment.

With the help of remark and rehype plugins, we can view the markdown files just like in Obsidian. Although it's quite hard for me to implement all these extensions, I will try to narrow the gap between them.
